# About

Hello, my name is Julian Webb. 

I am a self-taught programmer, web developer, documenation reader and a pro-taught Network Engineer and System Administrator.

In my hobbies, I frequently create things, sometimes finishing them. My hope is to document my process and learnings here, if only so I can go back and remember what I know.
