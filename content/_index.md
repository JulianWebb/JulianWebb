# Welcome

This is the personal site of Julian Webb.

The contents will include (but are not limited to):
* Information about my projects, certifications, etc.
* Log entries about my projects, things I've used, things I think about
* Some ways to contact me, such as email, discord.

Don't expect anything too exciting.
