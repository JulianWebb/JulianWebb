      <description>About Hello, my name is Julian Webb.
I am a self-taught programmer, web developer, documenation reader and a pro-taught Network Engineer and System Administrator.
In my hobbies, I frequently create things, sometimes finishing them. My hope is to document my process and learnings here, if only so I can go back and remember what I know.
Experience As I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any current experience in the fields I wish to work in, have a link to my LinkedIn instead.</description>
