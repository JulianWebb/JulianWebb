I"G<p> Recently I had the opportunity to reflect on my choices regarding instant messaging platforms. Discord has been my go-to for the past half-decade, with limited jaunts to IRC, Matrix, etc. for troubleshooting efforts, which feels odd in retrospect considering before that I was using everything from AIM, MSN Messenger, IRC, to even home-grown implementations found the roads less travelled.</p>

<p>Now don’t get me wrong, having to only deal with a single application/account definitely has it’s perks; as long as platform has the features you want it just <em>works</em>. However it also has it’s downsides; once you’re in you’re more or less locked-in unless you got a high enough charisma stat to get people to follow you to a new platform or are willing to make a whole new friend group outside of it.</p>

<p>Anyways, this is all to say, I wanted to branch out again, test the instant messaging waters so to speak, and after some research I decided to try setting up a Synapse homeserver. Why? Becuase go big or go home.</p>
