## About me 

My name is Julian Webb. I am a self-taught programmer looking to make stuff people want to use.

I’ve been developing on and off for decades, ever since I first got access to the internet in the 00s and learnt what a Neopet was. While most of my work is sadly lost to time, it’s definitely shaped how I think about technology today.

Most of my repositories here contain projects built using NodeJS and JavaScript, it really is a versatile tool. I do have experience with other languages however, such as Python, Ruby, Lua, PHP, FORTRAN, Basic, etc., it’s just so tempting to always fallback on JavaScript!

My latest project is [xCBC](https:/xcbc.ca), a bodge to fix CBC's link previews on discord that I’ve written in, you guessed it, JavaScript. It aims to be a useful tool until CBC fixes the problem themselves.

## Blog

I have a blog, I post things sometimes. Some of it might be worth reading.
