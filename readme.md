Hello!

My name is Julian Webb. I am a decent programmer and a work in progress artist.

I mainly work with Javascript, but I also enjoy using other languages.

My latest personal project is a gopher server I've called [Hadfield](https://github.com/julianwebb/hadfield).   
I have a public instance of it running at `julianwebb.ca`. (Github won't let me make a link with the gopher URI scheme)     
[![julianwebb/hadfield - GitHub](https://gh-card.dev/repos/julianwebb/hadfield.svg?fullname=)](https://github.com/julianwebb/hadfield)

I also have a [personal blog](https://julianwebb.ca) where I post stuff.

If you need to contact me, you can do via [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@julian:julianwebb.ca) or via [email](mailto:email@julianwebb.ca).

Happy trails.
